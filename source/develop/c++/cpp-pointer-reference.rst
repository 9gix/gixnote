C++ Pointer vs Reference
========================

Declaration:

* Pointer: asterisk `*`
* Reference: ampersand `&`

Accessing Members:

* Pointer: fat arrow `->`
* Reference: dot operator `.`

Consideration:

* Pointer allows NULL. Reference not NULL.
* Pointer can be reassign. Reference fixed.

Hint:

* Use Reference until you can't, then use pointer.
